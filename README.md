# Basic-SQL

The beginnings of SQL. For the intial chapters I will be using the classical models database. Hopefully it can be found on the internet and its easily downloadable.


### SELECT & FROM 
****syntax****

SELECT column_name, column_name2, column_name3 etc 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition e.g. name ='Glen'
AND/OR condition2 etc
